This is an MCMC Bayesian Spectral Energy Distribution fitting for HST photometry. The current release has been tested with ACS and WFC3-IR data.

Maintenance and current development of this MCMC Bayesian SED fitting tool is led by Giovanni M. Strampelli (STScI).
A special thanks to Dr. Massimo Robberto (STScI), Dr. Laurant Pueyo (STScI), Dr. Jonathan Aguilar (STScI) and Professor
Antonio Aparicio (ULL) for their guidance during the development of the pipeline.
